<h2> history of programming languages </h2>
<p>
During 1842–1849, Ada Lovelace translated the memoir of Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea <br/>
about Charles Babbage's newest proposed machine: the Analytical Engine; she supplemented the <br/>
memoir with notes that specified in detail a method for calculating Bernoulli numbers with the<br/>
 engine, recognized by some historians as the world's first published computer program.[3]<br/>
The first computer codes were specialized for their applications: e.g.,<br/>
 Alonzo Church was able to express the lambda calculus in a formulaic way<br/>
 and the Turing machine was an abstraction of the operation of a tape-marking machine.<br/>
To some people, some degree of expressive power and human-readability is required before <br/>
the status of "programming language" is granted. Jacquard Looms and Charles Babbage's Difference<br/>
 Engine both had simple, extremely limited languages for describing the actions that these machines<br/>
 should perform.

<h3> What was the first programming language?</h3>
<p> 
It’s generally accepted that Ada Lovelace’s “Algorithm for the Analytical Engine” is the first computerbr<br/>
 language ever created. Its purpose was to help Charles Baggage with Bernoulli number computations<br/>
 and Ada designed it in 1883. Lovelace describes her machine as different from previous calculating <br/>
 machines because of its ability to be programmed to solve problems of any complexity. Her contributions<br/>
 to the computer programming world are important because it showed the capabilites of computed devices<br/>
 almost 100 years before the thought of a modern programming computer was realized<br/>
